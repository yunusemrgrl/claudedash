# Worktree Observability

When running multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel across different git worktrees, agent-scope can show you which branch each session is working in, whether its worktree is clean, and which tasks are associated with it.

## What is a git worktree?

A git worktree is an additional working directory attached to the same repository. It lets you check out different branches simultaneously without stashing or switching:

```bash
# Create a worktree for a feature branch
git worktree add ../my-project-feature feature/auth

# Now you can run Claude Code in each worktree independently
cd ../my-project          # main branch
cd ../my-project-feature  # feature/auth branch
```

This is particularly useful when running multiple AI agents on different tasks in parallel — each agent gets its own branch and working directory, and their changes don't interfere.

## The Worktrees tab

Open the **Worktrees** tab in the dashboard to see all worktrees for the project:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Directory basename + dirty indicator (⚠ dirty / ✓ clean) |
| Branch | Current checked-out branch |
| Ahead/Behind | Commits ahead ↑ or behind ↓ relative to upstream |
| Tasks | Number of agent tasks associated with this worktree |

Click any row to expand it and see:
- Full path to the worktree
- HEAD commit SHA (abbreviated)
- List of tasks currently running in this worktree

The panel auto-refreshes every 30 seconds and has a manual refresh button.

## How task association works

agent-scope matches sessions to worktrees by comparing `session.cwd` against `worktree.path`. It uses **longest-prefix matching** — if a session's cwd is `/home/user/project/sub`, it will be matched to the worktree at `/home/user/project/sub` rather than `/home/user/project`.

If multiple sessions share the same worktree (e.g. parallel agents), all their tasks appear in the expanded worktree row.

## Dirty detection and ahead/behind tracking

When loading the worktree panel, agent-scope runs:

1. `git status --porcelain` to detect uncommitted changes (dirty = any output)
2. `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...@{u}` to count ahead/behind commits

Both commands run for each worktree in parallel. If a worktree has no upstream configured (detached HEAD, no remote branch), ahead/behind counts stay at 0 — no error is raised.

## Best practices for parallel execution

1. **One branch per task slice**: Create a worktree per major feature or sprint slice. This keeps agent changes isolated and easy to review.

2. **Watch ahead counts**: A high ahead count means the agent's branch has diverged significantly from upstream. Consider merging or rebasing before the branch grows too large to review.

3. **Monitor dirty state**: A persistent dirty indicator across refreshes may mean the agent left uncommitted work. Check before starting a new session in that worktree.

4. **Clean up worktrees**: After merging, remove the worktree with `git worktree remove ../my-project-feature`. Stale worktrees continue to appear in the dashboard until removed.

## API

```
GET /worktrees
```

Returns `{ worktrees: WorktreeState[] }` with enriched status. Degrades gracefully:
- Returns `[]` when not in a git repository
- Returns `[]` when git is not installed
- Never returns a 500 error

### WorktreeState schema

```typescript
interface WorktreeState {
  path: string;           // Absolute path to worktree
  branch: string;         // Current branch (or "(detached HEAD)")
  head: string;           // Commit SHA
  dirty: boolean;         // Has uncommitted changes
  aheadCount: number;     // Commits ahead of upstream
  behindCount: number;    // Commits behind upstream
  associatedTasks?: Array<{
    sessionId: string;
    taskId: string;
    taskSubject: string;
  }>;
}
```
