### Thread 1: LAUNCH THREAD (pin this)

> **Visual:** `hero-dashboard.png` attached to tweet 1

**Tweet 1/10**
```
I've been running 5 Claude Code agents in parallel for 3 months.

For 3 months I had zero visibility into what they were doing.

Then I built claudedash. Here's what I see now 🧵
```

**Tweet 2/10**
```
One command. That's it.

  npx -y claudedash@latest start

Opens localhost:4317 in 5 seconds.
Live Kanban. Context health. Cost tracker. Zero config.
```
> **Visual:** Terminal GIF showing startup

**Tweet 3/10**
```
The feature I didn't know I needed until I had it:

Context Health.

🟢 Under 65% → safe
🟡 65–75% → warning
🔴 Over 75% → critical

Now I know exactly when my agent is about to lose its mind.
Not after. Before.
```
> **Visual:** `context-health.png`

**Tweet 4/10**
```
Running agents on 3 branches simultaneously?

claudedash shows all of them.
Per-worktree status. Per-branch context health.
Which branch is stuck. Which is flying.

This is the feature that convinced my team.
```
> **Visual:** `worktrees.png`

**Tweet 5/10**
```
Plan Mode is where it gets serious.

Drop a queue.md with your tasks.
claudedash renders a dependency graph.
Tracks READY → IN_PROGRESS → DONE → BLOCKED in real time.

It's a sprint board for your AI agents.
No Jira. No Notion. Just files.
```
> **Visual:** `plan-mode.png`

**Tweet 6/10**
```
The wildest part:

I added the MCP server.
Then I asked Claude "what tasks do I have left?"

It queried its own dashboard and answered me.

🤖 watching itself work.
We're living in a simulation and I'm fine with it.
```

**Tweet 7/10**
```
No database. No cloud. No API key. No telemetry.

Everything stays on your machine.
Reads ~/.claude/tasks/ passively.
Doesn't touch your agents. Doesn't slow anything down.

Pure observer. Zero footprint.
```

**Tweet 8/10**
```
It also tracks:

→ Quality gates (lint + typecheck + test per task)
→ Hook integration (PreToolUse / PostToolUse)
→ Billing blocks (5-hour rolling cost window)
→ Session history + prompt replay

All from files. All local. All real-time.
```

**Tweet 9/10**
```
Add this to your CLAUDE.md:

  Before starting, check claudedash at localhost:4317
  to see current task queue and context health.

Now your agent knows about its own dashboard.
The loop closes.
```

**Tweet 10/10**
```
162 commits. Built in public. v1.1.21 dropped today.

If you use Claude Code and don't have this open,
you're flying blind.

### Thread 2: Context Health Deep Dive

**Tweet 1/4**
```
Your Claude Code agent just silently degraded.

You won't know for another 20 minutes.

Here's the number you should have been watching 🧵
```

**Tweet 2/4**
```
Claude Code sessions have a context window.
When it fills up, the agent starts forgetting earlier instructions.
Quality drops. Loops form. Weird behavior appears.

Most people debug for 30 minutes before realizing what happened.
```

**Tweet 3/4**
```
claudedash shows you a live % based on the last API call.

65% → yellow warning
75% → red critical

You see it coming. You intervene. Or let it compact.
But now it's YOUR decision — not a surprise.
```

**Tweet 4/4**
```
The math: last message's input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens
divided by model max.

No guessing. No sampling. The actual number.

npx -y claudedash@latest start

### Thread 3: 5-Second Setup

**Tweet 1/3**
```
Most developer tools have a README that starts with "Prerequisites."

claudedash has a README that starts with one command.

That difference matters more than you think. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2/3**
```
[GIF: terminal → command → browser open → dashboard live in 4.8s]

No npm install -g.
No config files.
No .env.
No Docker.

The first time you run it, it just works.
```

**Tweet 3/3**
```
Tools with friction get evaluated then abandoned.
Tools with zero friction get adopted then shared.

The "send this to your team" moment only happens
if you can say: one command, it works.

claudedash ships at 4.8 seconds.

### Thread 4: Plan Mode Walkthrough

**Tweet 1/4**
```
I run AI agents like a proper engineering team now.

Backlog. Sprint board. Dependency graph. Acceptance criteria.

All from a markdown file. Zero new tools. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2/4**
```
Create .claudedash/queue.md:

  ## S1-T1 — Auth API [depends: none]
  ## S1-T2 — Frontend [depends: S1-T1]
  ## S1-T3 — E2E tests [depends: S1-T2]

claudedash reads it. Renders the dependency graph.
Agent logs to execution.log. Dashboard syncs live.
```
> **Visual:** `plan-mode.png`

**Tweet 3/4**
```
Why this changes team standups:

The execution log IS the standup.

No "what did Claude do all night?"
The answer is timestamped, structured, already there.
```

**Tweet 4/4**
```
This is Plan Mode.

queue.md + execution.log + dependency graph + AC tracking.

It's a sprint board for your AI agent.
No extra tools. No integrations.

### Thread 5: MCP Recursion

**Tweet 1/4**
```
I gave my AI agent access to its own dashboard.

It can now check task status, context health, and billing.

The recursion is making me uncomfortable. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2/4**
```
Add to claude_desktop_config.json:

{
  "claudedash": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "claudedash@latest", "mcp"]
  }
}

Claude can now call:
get_sessions · get_snapshot · get_context_health
```

**Tweet 3/4**
```
Real example:

Me: "How far along is the auth feature?"

Claude: [calls get_snapshot]
"S1-T2 is in progress. S1-T1 completed 23 minutes ago.
2 tasks remaining in the sprint."

I didn't look at a single file.
```

**Tweet 4/4**
```
This is what meta-agent architectures look like in practice.

An orchestrator agent can query sub-agent dashboards.
Status propagation. No custom API glue.

### Post 1: Engineering Lead (Long Form)

> **Visual:** `worktrees.png` or `hero-dashboard.png`
> **Carousel suggestion:** 6 slides (dashboard → context health → worktrees → plan → MCP → install command)

```
I used to spend the first 30 minutes of every morning running
cat ~/.claude/tasks/*.json to figure out what my agents did overnight.

That's done now.

We've been running Claude Code agents across 4 parallel worktrees for 6 weeks.
One agent per feature branch. The output has been impressive — but the visibility
was zero. You'd come back, see 200 new lines of code, and spend 20 minutes
reconstructing what actually happened.

claudedash solves this at the infrastructure level.

Single command: npx -y claudedash@latest start

What you get immediately:
✅ Live Kanban of every agent's task state
✅ Context health % per session (critical for long overnight runs)
✅ Per-worktree observability (which branch, which agent, what status)
✅ Cost tracking (5-hour billing blocks)
✅ Plan Mode: queue.md → dependency graph → execution log

The part that changed our team meetings: the execution log IS the standup.
No more "what did the agent do?" The answer is timestamped and structured.

If your team uses Claude Code and you're not monitoring it,
you're not running AI agents. You're running AI hope.

### Post 2: Technical Credibility

> **Visual:** Code snippet / architecture diagram

```
The hardest part of building claudedash wasn't the Kanban.
It was the context health calculation.

Here's why it matters and how we solved it.

Claude Code sessions don't expose context usage directly.
The data is in JSONL files — but the naive approach of summing all
input_tokens across the session gives a wildly inflated number.

We shipped this. It showed 100% context health for every session.
Users noticed immediately.

The correct approach: use only the LAST message's input_tokens +
cache_read_input_tokens. This reflects what's actually in the model's
context window right now — not cumulative history.

We track lastInputTokens and lastCacheReadTokens separately (overwrite,
never accumulate) and compute:

  (lastInputTokens + lastCacheReadTokens) / modelMaxTokens

The result: a live, deterministic, accurate context health indicator.

🟢 Under 65% — safe
🟡 65–75% — time to plan a checkpoint
🔴 75%+ — compaction imminent

This is the kind of detail that separates tools that work
from tools that feel right.

### Post 3: Show Your Team (Carousel)

> **Carousel:** 6 slides — each feature as one slide, final slide = install command
> **Visual:** Real screenshots per slide

```
I sent my team one screenshot on Monday morning.
By Friday, every engineer had it running.

The screenshot was of the worktree panel.
Four branches. Four agents. All visible in one view.
One was blocked. One was at 71% context. Two were flying.

My CTO's reply: "wait, how?"

That's the claudedash pitch.
Not a features list.
One screenshot that makes someone ask "wait, how?"

### Post 4: Zero-Dependency Philosophy

```
The best developer tools don't add to your stack. They observe it.

claudedash is built on this philosophy:

→ No database. Claude Code already writes to ~/.claude/tasks/. We read it.
→ No cloud. Your agent data stays on your machine. Always.
→ No config. Point it at a directory, it figures the rest out.
→ No agent modification. We watch. We don't touch.

This is what "passive execution observer" means.
The tool doesn't make choices for you.
It shows you what's happening so you can.

In a world where every AI tool wants to be your new operating system,
there's something genuinely refreshing about a tool that just watches.

### r/ClaudeAI — Post 1

**Title:** `I got tired of not knowing what my Claude Code agents were doing, so I built a dashboard. One command to start.`

```
Hey r/ClaudeAI,

I've been running 3–5 Claude Code agents in parallel for a few months
and the lack of visibility was killing me.

So I built claudedash — a real-time local dashboard that reads Claude's
task files and renders a live Kanban.

**What it does:**
- Live task Kanban (pending → in_progress → completed → blocked)
- Context health % per session (65% warn, 75% critical)
- Worktree observability — see all your branches at once
- Plan Mode: queue.md + dependency graph + execution.log
- MCP server: Claude can query its own dashboard
- Cost tracker, hook integration, session history

**What it doesn't do:**
- Phone home. Zero telemetry. All local.
- Modify your agents. Pure passive observer.
- Require config. One command: npx -y claudedash@latest start

The context health feature is the one people love most — instead of being
surprised when an agent degrades, you watch the % creep up and intervene.

GitHub: https://github.com/yunusemrgrl/claudedash

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation.
Built with Fastify + chokidar + Next.js static export.
```

---

### r/LocalLLaMA — Post 2

**Title:** `Built a zero-dependency local dashboard for Claude Code agents. No cloud, no DB, no telemetry. Filesystem watching only.`

```
If you're running Claude Code locally and want observability without
giving anything to anyone — this might be for you.

claudedash is a local Fastify server that watches ~/.claude/tasks/
and renders a live dashboard. Static Next.js frontend, SSE for updates,
no external services.

**Architecture:**
- Server: Fastify + chokidar file watcher
- Frontend: Next.js static export
- Data: reads .jsonl files Claude writes natively
- SSE singleton (one shared connection for all hooks)
- MCP server for agent self-querying
- Server-side mtime-based cache (no unnecessary file reads)

**Context health implementation:**
last message's (input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens) / model_max
Not cumulative. Just current window state.

Everything local. npx install. No setup.

github.com/yunusemrgrl/claudedash

Would love feedback from people running local agent setups.

### r/programming — Post 3

**Title:** `Show r/programming: claudedash — real-time observer for AI coding agents`

```
**Show r/programming:** claudedash

Context: I use Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI agent) heavily.
It runs autonomously, modifies files, executes tasks.
The problem: zero native observability.

So I built claudedash:

1. Watches ~/.claude/tasks/ passively (no agent modification)
2. Live Kanban of task states
3. Context health % in real time
4. Per-worktree agent status
5. MCP server: Claude can query itself
6. GET /debug/timing → p50/p95/max per endpoint (for local profiling)

**Technical:**
- TypeScript + Fastify + chokidar
- SSE for browser updates (module-level singleton, 3 connections → 1)
- Server-side mtime-based caching for hot endpoints
- Static Next.js export, zero server rendering

162 commits, MIT license, built in public.

Happy to discuss architecture decisions.

## Hacker News Post

**Title:** `Show HN: claudedash – real-time local dashboard for Claude Code agents`

```
Hi HN,

I've been using Claude Code heavily for autonomous agent workflows and hit
a consistent pain point: zero visibility into what's running, what's stuck,
and how close to context overflow each session is.

So I built claudedash. One command:

    npx -y claudedash@latest start

Opens a local dashboard on port 4317. It passively watches ~/.claude/tasks/
(the files Claude Code writes natively) and renders:

- Live Kanban: pending → in_progress → completed → blocked
- Context health % per session (last-message tokens / model max)
- Worktree observability (per-branch agent status)
- Plan Mode: reads queue.md, renders dependency graph, syncs execution.log
- MCP server: so Claude can query its own dashboard
- Cost tracker, hook event log, session history

Technical notes for the curious:
- Fastify + chokidar for the server
- SSE (one shared connection via module-level singleton)
- Server-side mtime-based caching (no unnecessary file reads)
- Static Next.js export, no server rendering
- Zero telemetry, fully local

The context health feature was trickier than expected — the naive approach
of summing all input_tokens gives wildly wrong numbers. The correct approach
is using only the last message's token counts.

```markdown
## Monitoring

Before starting a multi-step task, check claudedash at localhost:4317
to review current task queue and context health percentage.

If context health > 65%, plan a compaction checkpoint.
If context health > 75%, compact immediately before proceeding.

After completing tasks, verify they appear as DONE in the dashboard.
