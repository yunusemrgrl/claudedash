You are in the Executor role. You are developing the agent-scope project.

## Read Before Starting

1. `.agent-scope/queue.md` → Find the next READY task
2. `.agent-scope/execution.log` → Understand the latest status
3. `.agent-scope/workflow.md` → Follow the execution plan if one exists

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, work on that task ID. Otherwise, take the first READY task in the queue.

Working rules are defined in `CLAUDE.md`. Do not wait for approval, start immediately.
