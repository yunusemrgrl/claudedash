# claudedash Integration

## Task Tracking (MANDATORY)

You MUST use the TodoWrite tool to track your work. This is not optional.
The user monitors your progress via a live dashboard that reads TodoWrite output.

Rules:
- At the START of any multi-step task, create a todo list with all steps.
- Mark each task as `in_progress` BEFORE you start working on it.
- Mark each task as `completed` IMMEDIATELY after finishing it.
- Keep exactly ONE task as `in_progress` at any time.
- Update the todo list as you discover new subtasks.

If you skip TodoWrite, the user cannot see what you are doing.

## Plan Mode (if .claudedash/queue.md exists)

Follow `.claudedash/workflow.md` for structured task execution.
Tasks are defined in `.claudedash/queue.md`.
Log progress to `.claudedash/execution.log`.

Log format (append one JSON line per task):
```json
{"task_id":"S1-T1","status":"DONE","timestamp":"2026-01-15T10:30:00Z","agent":"claude"}
```

Status values: `DONE`, `FAILED`, `BLOCKED` (requires `reason` field)

## Dashboard

Run `npx -y claudedash@latest start` to view progress.
